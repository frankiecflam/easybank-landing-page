## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5 with custom variables
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Why I took this challenge
This is a coding challenge from Frontend mentor. The main purpose of coding this website is to practise my newly-learned Bootstrap 5.


### What I learned

#### Bootstrap 5
Throughout this project, I made use of plenty of Bootstrap 5's features, including typography, card & navbar components and utility classes.
Bootstrap performed outstandingly in terms of mobile responsiveness, with tons of pre-made components in its arsenal.
